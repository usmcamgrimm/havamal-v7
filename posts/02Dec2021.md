Another year's cycle is closing in, and SÃ³l herself will give path for the freezing winter darkness to curtain our realms in the time to come. Yet a glimmer is seen in this era of night; Spotify Wrapped 2021.

We, the hymn-weavers of Havamal, would like to thank each and everyone of our Einherjars and Valkyries for staying true to the pagan cause and invite our hymns to your mind and soul!

The times are still tough throughout the world and We pray to Odin that all our warriors stay as safe a s possible. But one day We will claw our way back to the bright future to come, and hope that 2022 will bring the Era of live shows and a glint of a normal way of life again.

Once again, a thousand bloodied thanks to all you chosen ones of Odin! Hail Spotify Wrapped! Hail those that made the numbers! Hail our pagan hordes! Hail Odin's wisdom! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
