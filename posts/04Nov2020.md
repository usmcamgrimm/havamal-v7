As the forges continues to spit fire and brimstone from the massive roots from the hidden mines of Yggdrasil, the hymn-weavers will now enter the ever-mist to start hammering out the next part of our new saga.. The rhythm guitars will soon soon start shaking and trembling the under-realms like a strike from Thor itself!

Svartalfheim will give a smurked smile with this gift for the gods and race of men alike..

Hail the rhythm-guitars! Hail SolnaSound Recording! Hail the northern spirit! Hail the cold North! Hail her harsh and luring call! Hail our fearsome hordes! Hail Odin! Hail Havamal!
