Today, proud heathens of Odin's wisdom, We celebrate the passing of another years cycle for our very own axe-wielder and shield-brother Kjell Gilliusson, whom turned himself 41 young years!
May his meadhorn never drain, may his troubles be few and his axe forever swing in the name of the One-Eyed God!

Happy birthday Kjelle! We, the hymn-weavers, salute you! Hail Kjelle! Hail the celebrations! Hail our fearsome hordes! Hail Havamal!
