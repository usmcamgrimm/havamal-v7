Odin's warriors!

Now We draw ever closer to our new hymn-collection with the thundering rythm guitars all done!

From the forges at SolnaSound Recording fire belches and hope for a new sagas birth in a close proximity, stay vigilant, proud horde.

Hail the rhythm guitars! Hail our axe wielders skill! Hail Solna Sound Recordings! Hail our new beast! Hail our fearsome paganists! Hail Odin's wisdom! Hail Havamal!
