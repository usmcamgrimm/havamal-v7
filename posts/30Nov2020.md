Proud Einherjars and Valkyries!

Another forge now spews out the blazed gift to the aesir faith in the shape of rumbling bass sounds from deep below the earths surface!

The tunes from our mighty bass just finished the recording to our new album, and We, the hymn-weavers, could not hope to please the aesirs more with such a musical gift!

The album draws ever-closer, our fellow pagan faithgivers...

Hail the bass-hymns! Hail SolnaSound Recording Hail this new albums dawning! Hail our loyal horde! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
