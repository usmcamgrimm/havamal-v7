Proud Havamalians, disciples of Odin, heed!

The ravens now bring forth whispers from the forges at Solna Sound Recording that the musical smith masters Simon Johansson (Wolf, Soilwork, Memory Garden, Bibleblack) and Mike Wead (King Diamond, Mercyful Fate, Bibleblack) are in the final stages of the mixing of the brand new Havamal chapter.

We, the hymn-weavers, couldn't be more excited and thrilled over this new beast spawned from raw pagan power!

The new dawn will soon reveal itself, proud warriors! Stay patient, and let Odin's undying flame guide your path!

Hail Solna Sound Recordings! Hail Simon and Mike! Hail this new album! Hail the hordes that keep the Aesir faith alive! Hail the hymn-weavers!

Hail Havamal!
