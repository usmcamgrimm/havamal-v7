Odin's blessings upon all our Einherjars and Valkyries around the Nine Realms!

This is how We celebrate the release of our new beast of an album!

Tell us, have you listened to our hymns yet and which one did befell you the most!?

And to you, who have reached out and written fine words about our anthems. Own words, reviews and whatnot, we just want to say TACK!

Hope to see you soon on a musical raid and in a drunken musical rage! May not one ear remain untouched by our new saga, and may Odin grant you a glorious death and a grand legacy!

SKÃ…L!
