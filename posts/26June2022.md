Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

A while back we celebrated the one year anniversary for The Shadow Chapter with a small competition.

The wisdom of the Gods have now allowed us to draw a lucky winner out of a drinking horn (Old-school drawing, we know)!

All hail the winner of a signed CD and T-shirt: Carsten Badorek!

The winner will be contacted via PM on Facebook!

Hail the winner! Hail the Gods' wisdom! Hail Havamal!
