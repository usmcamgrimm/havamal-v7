Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

Our debut album "Tales from Yggdrasil" was released on this glorious day two years ago! Time truly flies.. yet this proud beast has aged like a fine mead and to this day We couldn't be more proud of our titanous hymn-debut!

Tell us, warriors, what track/tracks caught your attention and became an instant classic for you in the eyes of the olden gods?

Hail Tales from Yggdrasil! Hail its legacy! Hail the beginning! Hail those that supported us through the years that came and to come! Hail the hymn-weavers!

Hail Havamal!
