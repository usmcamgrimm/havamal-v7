Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Here's an interview with the owner Tekin of [Jakobs K√∂k & Bar](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jakobs-K%C3%B6k-Bar/230423097886287) in Jakobsberg, Stockholm. The place We played a week ago.

The interview is in Swedish and talks about the gang violence that disappeared from the bar when he opened up the metalclub [Klubb Fredagsmangel](https://www.facebook.com/klubbfredagsmangel/) together with Nisse and Micke, and started with livebands every friday and later on, saturdays.

And it seems that our music struck Tekin's heart üòè

We are still very overwhelmed by the welcoming from Tekin, Nisse and the crew behind "Klubb Fredagsmangel".

From the bottom of our hearts, Thank you!
