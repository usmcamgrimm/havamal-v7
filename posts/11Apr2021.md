Valkyries and Einherjars, heed!

As you may have heard by now, We are about to release our second album "**The Shadow Chapter**" via Art Gates Records May 21.
The ravens now brings whispers that there has been a first review on the whole album. From the very first song to the last!
And it gave the album 9.5 out of 10!!
We cannot be more joyously overwhelmed by this first written approach!
We, the hymn-weavers, wishes for Odin's blessings upon you Valkyries Webzine!
