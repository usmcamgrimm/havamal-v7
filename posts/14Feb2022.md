Happy Valisblot to all of our Einherjars and Valkyries!

Even though the nordic tales takes a more drastic interpretation on handing someone your heart, the hymn-weavers of Havamal would like to extend a greeting on this joyous day and hope that all of our pagan hordes across the Nine realms celebrate and fair well, together or by themselves!

Hail the colors of the Blot! Hail Vali! Hail all our loving warriors! Hail Odin's infinite wisdom! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
