**7000 PAGANS STRONG!!!**

Our camp grows evermore. The pagan army now stands 7000 souls proud and counting! We're overwhelmed by your response to our hymns and We couldn't be happier to share these news and thank all of you, proud warriors of Odin's wisdom!

Hail our Einherjars and Valkyries! Hail the grand heathen fb army! Hail the Aesir flame across our realms! Hail the hymn-weavers!

Hail Havamal!
