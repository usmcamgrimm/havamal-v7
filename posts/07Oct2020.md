Swedish viking metal act HAVAMAL will release their upcoming album via Art Gates Records in 2021. The band will enter the studio very soon...

In words of the band:
"We, the hymn-weavers of Havamal, are really exited and happy to renew our alliance with Art Gates Records, and together we will release the next chapter of the Nordic sagas upon the world.

We are also extremely proud to be a part of the Art Gates family, and we cant wait to release our most epic tales so far in our history!

Prepare to battle with the most fierce of beasts in the Norse mythology, as Havamal continues the journey!"
