Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

Odin's faithful ravens brings whispers from the realms of a coming storm over Frankia.

Prepare Europe, the flames of the old gods will reach you soon enough..

Hail Cerunnos! Hail those that will join our battle! Hail you that reads this! Hail the hymn-weavers!

Hail Havamal!
