Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Ravens brings news that Havamal will spread the heathen flame to Germany, and you can partake in this rite at Coastrock Festival in 23rd-24th of September 2022!We will welcome the upcoming cold and darkness that follows when SÃ³l takes her somber farewell, and We invite all of our hordes to partake in this musical blot!

We hope that all of our fans and their friends and families out there are safe in these dark times. With Odin you shall prevail. Havamal wishes to sing about battletales, We never wish them on anyone.

Hail Coastrock Festival! Hail those that will join us! Hail the coming live shows! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
