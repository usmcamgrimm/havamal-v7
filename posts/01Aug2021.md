Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

Now ravens proudly proclaims the grand news that **HAVAMAL WILL PLAY AT
RAISE YOUR HOIRNS** !!!

This is our first festival, let alone our first offshore, so finally our Drakkars will land on the foreign soil of Bornholm, Denmark!

Hope to meet a grand horde of our pagan warriors for musical battle! The long isolation nights are finally over while SÃ³l herself smile upon us!

Hail Raise your horns! Hail the live gigs! Hail the warriors that will attend! Hail Odin's inspiration! Hail the hymn-weavers!

Hail Havamal!
