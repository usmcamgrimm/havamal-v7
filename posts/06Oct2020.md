Proud heathen warriors, heed!

Now, when the solar-stenched days are slowly dying out, and as a cold embrace from mother North covers our realms for the months to come, the ravens are once more sent out to proclaim:

**HAVAMAL ENTERS THE STUDIO AND RE-SIGNS WITH ART GATES RECORDS!!!**

Long have a somber silence lured, and We wanted to break this with some huge news for all our Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom! Rest assured, this will be a monster of an album!! And to all of you eagerly waiting, more news will follow soon. Havamal's hymn-weavers will guide you through this new era with a steady hand and a steel-cladded mind!

Hail these news! Hail our new studio! Hail Art Gates Records! Hail our patient hordes! Hail this new pagan blaze that reaches across the stars and night skies! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
