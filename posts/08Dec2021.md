Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

This years Spotify Wrapped have shown the fighting spirit of our most proud warriors of the Olden faith, and We are still humbled for all your undying support and dedication! Odins blessings upon you all, brave horde!

Hail our listeners! Hail Spotify Wrapped! Hail those that make Havamal possible! Hail Odin's infinite inspiration! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
